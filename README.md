# MutablePriorityQueue

Combines the implementation of a priority queue with hashing. The goal is to be
able to search for a specific key in the priority queue (i.e. not only the minimum key),
and to be able to remove a specific key (not only the minimum key).

To compile and run the program on terminal type:
    - make all

	- make runsearch100
	- make runsearch1000
	- make rundelete100
	- make rundelete1000
    - make newinsert100
    - make newinsert1000

To delete executables and object file type:
    -  make clean
