The files
<x>_numbers.txt
contain sets of integers.
For example 20_numbers.txt contains 20 integers, one on each line.
You can use any of them as <input_file_to_create_queue>.
You can start with 5_numbers.txt, or 20_numbers.txt to debug your program.
The file 100_test_search.txt contains some numbers to use as <input_file_to_check_search>.
So you can run:
./TestInsertAndSearch 100_numbers.txt 100_test_search.txt

The file 100_test_delete.txt contains some number to use as <input_file_to_check_delete>.
So you can run
./TestInsertAndDelete 100_numbers.txt 100_test_delete.txt

You can also test your program with 1000_numbers.txt and 10000_numbers.txt:
./TestInsertAndSearch 1000_numbers.txt 1000_test_search.txt
./TestInsertAndDelete 1000_numbers.txt 1000_test_delete.txt
